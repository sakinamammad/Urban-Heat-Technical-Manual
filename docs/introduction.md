# Introduction

## Purpose of the Codebook

The purpose of this codebook is to provide a structured framework that enables local governments and policymakers to identify priority areas for heat mitigation using spatial and satellite-based analysis. This codebook serves as both a technical guide and a documentation tool, enabling other researchers, policymakers, and local governments to understand and reproduce the team’s workflow. The manual is designed to help users apply the same methodology to their own contexts, enabling them to do:

- Pinpoint areas most in need of heat mitigation actions
- Implement interventions that align with the 3-30-300 framework


## Overview of the Project

**Project Title**

Using Satellite and GIS Data to Support Urban Heat Management

**Affiliation**

Carnegie Mellon University Heinz College - Capstone Project
In collaboration with the Climate Finance and Economics Unit, World Bank Group

**Project Context**

Urban heat is intensifying globally due to climate change, rapid urbanization, and loss of green cover, posing significant risks to health, productivity, and infrastructure. Vulnerable populations are disproportionately affected by rising temperatures, particularly in dense, low-income urban areas.
Cities require targeted, data-driven heat action plans to mitigate risk and enhance resilience. This project aims to support that need through spatial analysis and policy-relevant recommendations.

**3-30-300 Framework** (Cecil Konijnendijk 2021)

The 3-30-300 framework, developed by urban forester Dr. Cecil Konijnendijk, provides measurable indicators to guide equitable urban greening and cooling strategies:

- 3 trees visible from every home, school, or workplace
- 30% tree canopy cover in every neighborhood
- 300 meters or less distance from every residence to a public green space.

**Pilot City: Nairobi**

Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, was selected as the pilot city for this analysis due to its rapid urban growth and vulnerability to heat stress, particularly in informal settlements (Engel et al. 2025). The city’s uneven distribution of vegetation and green spaces has contributed to localized urban heat islands, where surface temperatures can be several degrees higher than surrounding rural areas. These heat disparities are often correlated with income, population density, and infrastructure access, which highlights the need for data-informed, equity-centered policy planning (Shirodkar 2024).

**Project Goals**

The project aims to:

- Identify urban heat hotspots using open-source geospatial datasets
- Assess vulnerability and equity impacts of urban heat exposure
- Support local governments in designing data-informed, equitable heat action plans
- Provide a replicable analytical framework for future World Bank applications


Ultimately, the project’s findings will help cities reduce heat-related mortality and illness, improve urban livability, and promote climate resilience.

**Analytical Focus**

The analysis combines climate, environmental, and socioeconomic data to assess patterns of urban heat exposure. Using the 3–30–300 framework, which examines tree visibility, canopy cover, and access to green spaces, the project evaluates the relationship between environmental factors and urban heat vulnerability.

Areas within cities are analyzed on the basis of:

- Surface urban heat island intensity
- Tree canopy and green space access
- Building density
- Social vulnerability considerations (e.g., employment, age, disability)


## Targeted Stakeholders

This project is designed for individuals and organizations working in urban planning, climate change, and social equity.

**Main stakeholders include:**

- City governments and urban planners: to use data for planning green areas, zoning, and cooling strategies
- Environmental and health agencies: to find which neighborhoods are most affected by heat and need more attention
- Community groups and NGOs: to support which neighborhoods that are most affected by heat and need more attention

# Urban Heat Technical Manual Repository

This repository contains the full technical documentation for replicating the Urban Heat Risk and 3-30-300 Framework Analysis conducted for Nairobi as part of the Carnegie Mellon University capstone project in partnership with the World Bank Climate Finance and Economics Unit.

The goal of this repository is to provide a transparent and fully reproducible workflow that cities, GIS analysts, and development practitioners can use to apply the same methodology in any urban area.

## What’s in This Repository

- Technical Manual (Markdown chapters) documenting the full workflow

- Data requirements and sources used in the Nairobi analysis

- Step-by-step GIS instructions for extracting, processing, and analyzing data

- Methods for calculating heat scores, social vulnerability scores, and 3-30-300 indicators

- Replication guidance, including recommended folder structures, metadata standards, and suggested future updates

- References and licensing for all datasets used

## How to Use This Manual

Use the left-side navigation (GitHub Pages) to move through the manual in order.
Each section is designed so analysts can follow it independently, even if they have limited prior knowledge of the workflow.

## Who This Manual Is For

- City planners and local government teams

- GIS analysts and technical specialists

- World Bank teams applying this model in new cities

- Researchers and students studying urban heat and resilience
